    "## Implement context-sensitive spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving this task, we expect you'll face (and successfully deal with) some problems or make up the ideas of the model improvement. Some of them are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- solving a problem of n-grams frequencies storing for a large corpus;\n",
    "- taking into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings;\n",
    "- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster;\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't forget to describe such cases, and what you decided to do with them, in the Justification section.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "Your project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n",
    "- Your implementation\n",
    "- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n",

    "The ngram language model seem to do a better job if we consider cases closer to real-life with typing errors, though the Norvig's approach is not so far behind. To me, it seems like that for the n-gram model the quality of the n-gram dataset and the dictionary of known words matter significantly. Regardless, I believe that we should look towards more advanced solutions like transformers, since the capture the meaning of tokens, not just their frequency in text."
